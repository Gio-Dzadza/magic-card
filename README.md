 Magic Match Card Game
 
 This is a web-based memory card game developed using React. The objective of the game is to match all pairs of cards with the same image in the fewest possible turns. The game starts with a set of cards arranged face-down. The player flips two cards each turn, trying to find a matching pair. If the two flipped cards match, they remain face-up and are removed from play. If they don't match, they are flipped face-down again and the player tries again on their next turn. The game ends when all pairs have been matched.

 The game has the following features:

- The cards are randomly shuffled each time the game starts, ensuring a unique experience every time.
- The player can input their name to personalize the game and have their score tracked in a leaderboard.
- The number of turns taken to complete the game is recorded and displayed at the end of the game.
- The leaderboard displays the top 10 players and their scores in ascending order.
